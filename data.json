Join or create a group with friends\n2. Propose a plan (\"Party at John's on Friday\")\n3. Plans appear in shared group feed\n4. Members RSVP in one tap\n5. Plans gain momentum or naturally die\u2014no endless back-and-forth\n\n**Key Feature - Shared Group Calendar:**\n- Shows what group is doing each day\n- Displays each friend's status\n- Makes conflicts immediately obvious\n\n**Initial Users:** College students - friend groups, parties, trips, clubs\n\n**Ad Concept:** Chaotic group chat trying to plan \u2192 Cut to Plannr: one plan, clear RSVPs, done.\n",

      "content": "Key breakthroughs in early 2026 reshaping voice AI: Nvidia's PersonaPlex-7B enables full-duplex conversation (simultaneous listen+speak), Inworld TTS 1.5 hits sub-120ms latency, and emotional intelligence is going mainstream. Gartner forecasts 40% of enterprise apps will integrate task-specific AI agents by year-end (up from <5% in 2025). VoiceRun raised $5.5M for enterprise voice agent platform. Speechmatics processed 30M+ minutes in healthcare alone. Relevant to Sessions: these advances in latency and full-duplex are exactly the direction voice-based reflection/planning tools should leverage. Source: webpronews.com (Jan 2026)",

      "content": "Competitive analysis for Plannr from SmarterTravel's roundup of group planning tools:\\n\\n**Direct competitors:**\\n- **Let's Jetty** (letsjetty.com) \u2014 Pre-planning phase: RSVP deadlines, travel preference surveys, polls for dates/destinations. Web-based, no app download. Closest to Plannr's proposal/voting model.\\n- **Troupe** (troupetravel.com) \u2014 Collaborative activity planning with voting. Everyone suggests, group votes, app builds itinerary. Solves the 'nobody wants to be the dictator' problem.\\n\\n**Adjacent tools groups cobble together:**\\n- **Wanderlog** \u2014 Itinerary building + route optimization + shared maps\\n- **Splitwise** \u2014 Expense splitting (recently added free tier limits, frustrating users \u2014 opportunity?)\\n- **Google Maps custom maps** \u2014 Shared pins for restaurants/attractions\\n\\n**Key insight for Plannr:** The market is fragmented. People use 3-4 apps to coordinate one trip. Plannr's unified feed with proposals + going/maybe/not going responses could replace the Let's Jetty + Troupe + group chat combo. The 'shared feed' model is differentiated \u2014 none of these competitors have a social-feed-style interface for group coordination.\\n\\nSource: https://www.smartertravel.com/the-apps-that-make-group-trip-planning-work/",

      "content": "Dario Amodei (Anthropic) predicts the first solo-founder unicorn by 2026. Solo-founded startups surged from 22% (2015) to 38% (2024) of new US startups. 52.3% of successful exits were solo founders. Key example: Maor Shlomo sold Base44 (AI startup) to Wix for $80M after 6 months, built entirely alone (300K users, $3.5M ARR). The thesis: AI tools have made it possible for one person to do what used to require a team \u2014 coding, design, marketing, ops.

The solo founder trend is real (Base44 sold for $80M). Jake already has two apps in flight.\n\n3. **AI Consulting for Finance** ($100-300/hr) \u2014 Jake's Morgan Stanley AI team background is a massive credibility signal. Financial services firms are desperate for AI expertise.\n\n4. **Prompt Engineering for Enterprises** ($50-150/hr) \u2014 Design system prompts, eval frameworks, and RAG pipelines. Upwork/Toptal have growing demand.\n\n5. **Template/Boilerplate Sales** \u2014 Sell starter kits (e.g., 'AI SaaS boilerplate with Stripe + Auth + OpenAI') on Gumroad.
